## Overview
My most commonly used matlab function files are in these directories.
To use them, simply download as zip file or if you are using git, clone them your local directory. 

Then, either add them to your Matlab path "globally" by going to Home -> Set Path. 
Then click on "add with subfolders" and locate the "db.toolbx" directory that you just downloaded.
